# Parkinsons-Cognitive-LLM

Automated extraction of cognitive domains from Parkinsonâ€™s disease patient-clinician conversations using large language models.

This repository contains the code for:

- De-identification scripts for clinical narratives
- Data preprocessing the manually annotated conversations and Tools for analyzing and visualizing cognitive domains
- Fine-tuning, merging model weights and evaluating Llama 3.1-8B (QLoRA) on named entity recognition and cognitive domain extraction tasks
- Post-processing and error analysis utilities for model outputs

Our goal is to develop and evaluate LLM-based tools for objective and automated cognitive assessment in neurology leveraging LLMs to extract nuanced clinical markers from real-world desciptive narratives of Parkinson's disease patients.

This project is part of our MS in Public Health (Health Informatics concentration) final group capstone on large language models for medical applications.

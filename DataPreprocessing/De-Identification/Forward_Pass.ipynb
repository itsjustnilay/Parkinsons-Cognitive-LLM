He puts each seedling into each hole, being careful not to disturb the seedlings too much. Then he covers each with excess dirt and pats them into the ground. Next, he puts the mesh tomato cage on, pushing down to the bottom rung.\\nNext, he goes into his garage and gets the blower.\\nHe blows the excess dirt into the grass of his backyard. He puts the blower away and grabs his watering can. He walks back outside and waters the tomato seedlings he just planted.\\nHe notices that some animals have been eating his other plants.

The sounds of birds calling and squirrels running around in nearby trees. The earthy smell of the dirt. The foul smell of blood meal.

Once she has finished, she closes the door and opens the left hand side of the closet. She repeats the same process.\\nNext, she removes her shoes from the floor of the closet. She sweeps the floor. She then looks at each shoe, putting the two shoes she will donate in a separate area. One of these is a pair of magenta velvet slippers, and the other is a pair of blue suede ballet flats. She places the boots she is keeping towards the front of the floor, while she places the sandals she's keeping further back in a corner.\\nShe then grabs the folded clothes she's stored at the top of the closet. She goes through each article of clothing, putting those she will donate on the pile on her bed and putting back the ones she will keep. She then grabs the cubes at the top of her closet. The first cube stores athletic wear, which she sorts through. She then sorts through her\\n\\\"resort\\\" cube, which contains clothing she typically wears on vacation.\\nNext, she walks over to her dresser. She opens the first drawer and sorts through her summer sweaters.\\nThen she opens her second drawers and sorts through her <<DATE:winter>> sweaters.\\nThen she takes the stack of clothes on her bed and rolls this up. She places this in a large trash bag.\\nWhen she pulls out a sweater she loves from her dresser, she discovers it's moth eaten. She considers whether she can sew it up, but eventually\\nshe decides she has to put it in the donation pile.\\nSlight discomfort in her body from standing and bending for a long time.\\nShe reminisces on the days when she wore her fancy Chanel suits. She thinks she can't donate them, even though she knows she likely won't wear them\\nShe thinks that she'll donate all athletic clothing she hasn't worn in a year.\\nShe feels content as she reminisces on her trip to <<LOCATION:Paris>> as she sorts through her resort bin.\\nShe feels joy when she sees clothes she wore when she got married.\\nAt the top of closet, found a cube that had small handbags and belts.

They eat some food that his daughter prepared, including homemade pizza and some salad. They reminisce on what things were like at his and his wife's wedding 42 years ago. They remember how the wedding was at a \\\"neutral\\\" church because his wife's priest didn't like all the \\\"add-ons\\\" they wanted to do. They talk about how two assistant principals from the high school did the readings and that they had a special organist and singer come down from <<LOCATION:Waterbury>>. His male friend then teases him about the way he had introduced his wife before they were engaged (he would always call her his \\\"friend from <<LOCATION:West Haven>>\\\"). They then talk more about the wedding, remembering how his father-in-law wanted to make sure the bathrooms at the venue were nice ahead of time. They also remember that the father-in-law had brought homemade wine that was very good.\\nEventually, his daughter brings out a small cake with candles that say \\\"42\\\" on it. While eating dessert, they exchange some cards. Eventually, they all say goodbye and head home.\\nOne of his friends notices that he's not eating all of the food. He tells them he's just having an off day and is taking it easy on his stomach, and the conversation moves along.\\nSounds of laughter\\nTaste of the food\\nReminiscing on old memories reminds him that his parents are no longer present to enjoy new memories.\\nHappiness at being with good friends and family\"\n",
